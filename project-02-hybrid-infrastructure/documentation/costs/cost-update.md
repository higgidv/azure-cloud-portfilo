# Cost Analysis - Project 02 Hybrid Infrastructure

## Current Monthly Cost Breakdown
| Resource                 | SKU/Size          | Monthly Cost | Purpose                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| VPN Gateway (On-Prem)    | VpnGw1            | ~$6.00       | Site-to-Site connectivity  |
| VPN Gateway (Production) | VpnGw1            | ~$6.00       | Site-to-Site connectivity  |
| Domain Controller VM     | B2s (2 vCPU, 4GB) | ~$6.00       | Active Directory services  |
| Storage & Networking     | Standard LRS      | <$1.00       | VM disks and data transfer |
| **Total Current**        |                   | **~$19.00**  |                            |

## Upcoming Production Services
| Resource                  | SKU/Size  | Monthly Cost | Status          |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| App Service               | F1 (Free) | $0.00        | Ready to deploy |
| SQL Database              | Basic     | ~$5.00       | Ready to deploy |
| **Total with Production** |           | **~$24.00**  |                 |

## Free Tier Budget Tracking
- **Original Credits**: $200
- **Current Usage**: ~$19/month
- **Projected with Production**: ~$24/month
- **Remaining Budget**: ~$176
- **Months of Operation**: 7+ months at current rate

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Implemented
- âœ… F1 Free tier for App Service
- âœ… Basic tier SQL Database (lowest paid option)
- âœ… VpnGw1 (lowest VPN gateway SKU)
- âœ… Standard LRS storage (cost-effective)

### Potential Optimizations
- ðŸ”„ Scheduled VM shutdown during non-demo hours
- ðŸ”„ Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows licensing (production)
- ðŸ”„ Reserved instances for long-term deployments
- ðŸ”„ Spot instances for non-critical workloads

## Enterprise Cost Management Practices
1. **Resource Tagging**: All resources tagged with cost center and environment
2. **Budget Alerts**: Can set up alerts at 80% of monthly budget
3. **Right-sizing**: VM upgraded only when performance required
4. **Monitoring**: Regular cost review and optimization

## Business Justification
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: $12/month for enterprise-grade VPN tunnels
- **Identity Services**: $6/month for centralized authentication
- **Application Platform**: $5/month for managed database services
- **Total Value**: Enterprise hybrid cloud capability for <$25/month

## ROI Analysis
- **Traditional On-Premises**: Would require physical servers, networking equipment, maintenance
- **Cloud-Only**: Would miss hybrid integration patterns crucial for enterprise adoption
- **Hybrid Approach**: Demonstrates real-world enterprise cloud adoption strategy

This cost structure demonstrates understanding of cloud economics and enterprise budget considerations.
