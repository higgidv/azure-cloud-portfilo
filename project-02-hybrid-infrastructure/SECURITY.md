# Security Considerations

## Demo Environment Disclaimers
⚠️ **This is a demonstration environment using placeholder credentials**

### NOT for Production Use
- Passwords are simple demo values
- No real sensitive data should be used
- All resources should be destroyed after demonstration

### Variable Management
- Sensitive values stored in `terraform.tfvars` (not committed)
- Production environments should use:
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Environment variables
  - CI/CD pipeline secrets
  - Terraform Cloud/Enterprise workspaces

### Enterprise Security Patterns Demonstrated
1. **Sensitive variable marking** - Variables marked as sensitive
2. **Secret separation** - No hardcoded secrets in .tf files
3. **Network segmentation** - Proper subnet isolation
4. **VPN encryption** - Site-to-site encrypted tunnels
5. **Resource tagging** - Cost center and environment tracking

### Production Recommendations
- Use managed identities where possible
- Implement Azure Key Vault ;integration
- Enable Azure Security Center
- Configure Azure Monitor for security alerts
- Implement proper RBAC controls
