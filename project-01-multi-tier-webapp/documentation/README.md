# Project 1: Enterprise Multi-Tier Web Application Infrastructure

## üìã Overview

Production-ready Azure networking infrastructure demonstrating enterprise security design and Infrastructure as Code best practices. Built with Terraform for scalability and maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è What I Built

### Core Infrastructure

- **Virtual Network (10.0.0.0/16)** - Enterprise-grade network foundation
- **4 Subnets** - Proper tier separation (Web/App/Data/Management)
- **3 Network Security Groups** - Firewall rules for each tier
- **Static Website Storage** - Production web hosting capability
- **Log Analytics Workspace** - Centralized monitoring and logging

### Architecture Pattern

```text
                Internet
                    ‚Üì
    Web Tier (10.0.1.0/24)     ‚Üê HTTP/HTTPS from internet
                    ‚Üì (Port 8080)
    App Tier (10.0.2.0/24)     ‚Üê Only from Web Tier
                    ‚Üì (Port 1433)
    Data Tier (10.0.3.0/24)    ‚Üê Only from App Tier
                    
    Management (10.0.4.0/24)   ‚Üê Admin access
```

## üîí Security Implementation

## üìö Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- **Azure Free Tier Quotas**: Compute resources have strict limits - plan architecture within quota constraints
- **Terraform State Management**: Proper state file handling is critical for team collaboration and infrastructure consistency
- **Security-First Design**: Implementing Network Security Groups before application deployment prevents security gaps
- **Resource Naming**: Consistent naming conventions with random suffixes enables automation and prevents conflicts

### Development Process
- **Infrastructure as Code Benefits**: Terraform enables repeatable, version-controlled deployments across environments
- **Modular Architecture**: Separating networking and compute concerns improves maintainability and reusability
- **Documentation During Build**: Creating documentation while building prevents knowledge loss and improves quality
- **Version Control Workflow**: Professional Git practices with meaningful commits demonstrate enterprise readiness

### Cloud Architecture Patterns
- **Multi-tier Design**: Subnet segmentation provides security boundaries and scaling flexibility
- **Zero-Trust Networking**: Explicit firewall rules between tiers reduce attack surface
- **Monitoring Foundation**: Early Log Analytics implementation enables observability from day one
- **Cost Optimization**: Strategic use of free tier resources while maintaining enterprise design patterns

### Project Management
- **Iterative Deployment**: Building networking foundation first enables adding compute layers incrementally
- **Quota Planning**: Understanding cloud provider limits informs architecture decisions
- **Professional Presentation**: Quality documentation significantly impacts portfolio effectiveness

*Multi-tier Azure infrastructure with security-first design and zero-trust network segmentation*

### Key Architectural Components
- **Internet Gateway**: Public entry point with traffic filtering
- **Web Tier**: Public-facing subnet for front-end applications
- **Application Tier**: Protected business logic layer with restricted access
- **Data Tier**: Secure database subnet with database-only traffic
- **Management Tier**: Administrative access with separate security controls

### Security Design Principles
- **Zero-Trust Networking**: Each tier explicitly controls allowed traffic
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (NSGs, subnets, monitoring)
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required access between tiers
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated subnets prevent lateral movement
